<h1>TSQL</h1>

A Python Environment Database Module Generator

<h3>Installation</h3>
to install using pip:

```bash
$ pip install tsql-yaboiteedoh
```

<h3>Usage</h3>
the bash command:

```bash
$ tsql
```

Runs the application in the current directory, allowing you to search it for
valid configuration files or generate a new database where you are

To get the most out of that I have it installed into a toolbox .venv, and have
added this function to my ~/.bashrc script:

```bash
sql() {
    (
        source '/home/teedoh/devkit/.venv/bin/activate'
        tsql
    )
}
```

Saving the configuration saves to the current directory under 
(database name).tsql
Default behavior is to not override previous saves, to enable easier version
control

Exporting the configuration folder dumps a python module named after the database
into the current directory, which you can reach with

```python
from {database name} import Database
```

once instantiated, you can reach into the database with the associated functions
on the table objects

```python
db = Database()
with db:
    table_entries = db.{table name}.read_all()
```

<h3>Functionality</h3>

*0.1.9*
- support for datatypes
    - TEXT
    - INT
    - BOOL
- Groups
    - search multiple columns for the same value
- Filters
    - return based on a combination of column and group values
- parameters
    - NOT NULL
    - PRIMARY KEY
    - AUTOINCREMENT
- Column Types
    - functions with dataclass object returns for unique column values
    - functions with list of dataclass object returns for shared column values
    - any column not labeled 'returns' is considered passive
        - these will exist on the dataclass object but not have an associated query function
- Column references
    - these will update dynamically as you alter your table config

*0.1.10*
- export module alterations
    - to use the database object via context manager
    - to remove create tables on database object init
        - instead use 

```python
database.init_tables()
```

*0.2.0*
- expanded data types and parameters
    - data types
        - TEXT
        - INTEGER
        - REAL
        - BLOB
    - parameters
        - PRIMARY KEY
        - AUTOINCREMENT
        - NOT NULL
        - CHECK
            - Saves expressions as entered
        - DEFAULT
            - Including support for
                - CURRENT_TIME
                - CURRENT_DATE
                - CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        - COLLATE (on TEXT columns)
- config validation
    - enforces unique table/column/filter/group names in their proper scopes
    - enforces non-empty groups and filters
    - More to come as cases emerge

*0.3.0*
- Hidden columns which will not appear on the dataclass object
    - Table dataclasses no longer use dataclass module
    - reading and updating values on hidden classes require rowid to query

*0.4.0 (planned)*
- Join tables

*0.5.0 (planned)*
- Built in version control system
- data migration tools

*1.0.0 (planned)*
- Interface overhaul
